# SoccerPlayerRatingPrdiction
Soccer Player Rating Prediction is a Flask-based web application that accurately predicts the rating of soccer players based on their performance attributes. 


This project is a Flask-based web application that predicts the rating of soccer players based on their performance attributes. With a user-friendly interface, users can input the player's performance metrics and obtain an accurate prediction of their rating.

Using machine learning techniques and the scikit-learn library, the application leverages a trained model to provide precise predictions. The model is built on a dataset containing historical player ratings and performance attributes, enabling it to learn patterns and make accurate predictions.

Key Features:
- User-friendly web interface for inputting player attributes
- Accurate prediction of player rating based on input attributes
- Integration of a trained machine learning model for improved accuracy
- Responsive design for optimal user experience across devices

Technologies Used:
Python, Flask, HTML, CSS, scikit-learn

Usage:
1. Install the required dependencies specified in the `requirements.txt` file.
2. Run the Flask application using the command `python app.py`.
3. Access the application through a web browser at `http://localhost:5000`.
4. Enter the performance attributes of the soccer player and click on the "Predict" button.
5. The predicted rating will be displayed on the result page.
